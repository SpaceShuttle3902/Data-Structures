# Data-Structures
Data Structures Projects
The purpose of this project is to read data from a file into a one-dimensional array and perform a variety pf functions on it.
1. The first step is to download the .cpp file (A1 Functions.ccp), header file(A1 Functions.h), main file(CS-303 A1.cpp), and of course the data file(A1input.txt) you intend to read information from.
2. From there you will run the program through whichever compiler you have access to and multiple options will be available for you (As shown in the picture below, also I used Visual Studio 2022).

4.  You have multiple options, option 1 lets you check if a number exists, In this example, I entered one for option 1 and searched for #20:

5. The next option is 2 which lets you modify a number in the array, I will modify the number 23 to 10 in index 22:

6.  Option 3 allows you to add a new number to the end of the array, I will add the number 302:

7. Option 4 allows you to remove a number from the array, I will enter index 10 to delete the number 11 from the array.

8. Option 5 will allow you to display the array, also to make sure your functions worked you can always choose this option after to make sure the change you did was successful or what you wanted.

9. The last option lets you exit the program, I'm sure a picture isn't needed for that.
